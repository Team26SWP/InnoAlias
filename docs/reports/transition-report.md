# Usefulness and transition 
### Usefulness
According to the customer, the product is complete and ready to be used. Only these parts are not fully finished:
- Game modes (addition of round variation is needed)
- Email confirmation (no confirmation due to lacking domen, all logic is in place)

The customer was not using the product at the moment of the meeting, because "the product was not ready to be used".
However, deployment on customer's side was successful.

To transition the product, the customer needs to be added to the list of organization's owners.

The customer plans to continue work on the product if a team of passionate developers is assembled. Merging with another team working on a similar product is theoretically possible. Otherwise, the product will just potentially be used on labs/lectures.

To increase the chances of the product actually being useful, further work has to be done to increase its convenience, e.g., add Innopolis SSO support as was suggested earlier.

According to the customer, the "About us" section of the README file has to be rephrased and maybe expanded, as well as the "Usage" section to provide instructions on specific scenarios. Otherwise, everything is clear, and no secitons need to be added.
