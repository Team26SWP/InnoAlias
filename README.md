## About the project

Alias is a game that helps you memorize terms. Players divide into teams, and in each team a player called the "game master" explains a word to their teammates, while they guess. The goal is to guess as many words as possible.

The problem with regular memorization methods is that they are often boring and too shallow. Our product solves this problem by making learning fun and efficient. Moreover, it makes playing with your friends convenient, as it introduces savable decks, flexible game settings and a deck gallery to share decks with others!

## Installation

### Running locally (via Docker)

If you want to **build and run everything from source on your own computer**, follow the steps below.

#### 1  Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Check |
|------|---------|-------|
| Docker Engine | â‰¥ 24.0 | `docker --version` |
| Docker Compose | v2 (bundled with Docker Desktop) | `docker compose version` |

> **Tip:** On Windows use WSL 2; on macOS use Docker Desktop.

---

#### 2  Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Team26/InnoAlias.git
cd innoalias
```

#### 3 Add local environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env # Secret key you can generate via command "openssl rand -base64 32"
nano .env
```

The .env file already contains safe defaults (no production secrets). Adjust anything you need.

#### 4 Launch the building!

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d --build
```

After build, you can use app on localhost.
